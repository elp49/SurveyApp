# survey.SurveyApp

Most of FileConfiguration, FileUtils, and SerializationHelper were taken from Sean Grimes, sean@seanpgrimes.com

The main function is located in survey.SurveyApp

SurveyApp works as expected and there are no know issues at this time.

The application does not allow the user to change correct test question answers or the number of correct test question answers.
When a user modifies an existing survey/test and then saves it, the original version of that survey/test is overwritten with the modified version.
This is the intended behavior.
